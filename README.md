to complite the task assignment i decidet to uss php with laravl

for auth i used laravels out of the pox package breeze that gives me fully functinal login registar and logout pages

for rontedn part i greated simple blade.php files 

to runn localy you will need to instal the vendor package from composer.jsno file

for secound part i created new controller for auth that returns tokens for registaring and logging,
and created new controller for projects and tasks 

using postman i tried the application auth works 
but for the rest methods from ProjectConntroler and TasksController returns 200 ok cokde but the output is not like json Resource
